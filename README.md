Machine Learning-Based Pre-miRNA Sequence Classifier
====================================================

This repository is a work-in-progress following the development of a
machine-learning pre-miRNA sequence classifier.

This work is being done as a requirement the IT Engineering degree
at [FICH-UNL](http://fich.unl.edu.ar/), Santa Fe, Argentina.

For now, the following folders are available in this repository:

* `data`, pre-miRNA and non-pre-miRNA datasets [done]
* `doc`, documents fulfilling academic requirements, in Spanish only [wip]
* `initial`, initial testing of pre-miRNA classifiers (libSVM/Matlab) [done]
* `misc`, obsolete and miscellaneous code
