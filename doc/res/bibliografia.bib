                  in sequence-specific interactions that inhibit gene

                  regulatory roles involving microRNAs and, in plants

                  retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) in

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 21 to
                  23-nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate
                  protein-coding gene expression in plants and animals
                  via the RNA interference pathway. Hundreds of them
                  have been identified in the last five years and very
                  recent works indicate that their total number is
                  still larger. Therefore miRNAs gene discovery
                  remains an important aspect of understanding this
                  new and still widely unknown regulation
                  mechanism. Bioinformatics approaches have proved to
                  be very useful toward this goal by guiding the
                  experimental investigations.RESULTS:In this work we
                  describe our computational method for miRNA
                  prediction and the results of its application to the
                  discovery of novel mammalian miRNAs. We focus on
                  genomic regions around already known miRNAs, in
                  order to exploit the property that miRNAs are
                  occasionally found in clusters. Starting with the
                  known human, mouse and rat miRNAs we analyze 20 kb
                  of flanking genomic regions for the presence of
                  putative precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Each genome
                  is analyzed separately, allowing us to study the
                  species-specific identity and genome organization of
                  miRNA loci. We only use cross-species comparisons to
                  make conservative estimates of the number of novel
                  miRNAs. Our ab initio method predicts between fifty
                  and hundred novel pre-miRNAs for each of the
                  considered species. Around 30\% of these already
                  have experimental support in a large set of cloned
                  mammalian small RNAs. The validation rate among
                  predicted cases that are conserved in at least one
                  other species is higher, about 60\%, and many of
                  them have not been detected by prediction methods
                  that used cross-species comparisons. A large
                  fraction of the experimentally confirmed predictions
                  correspond to an imprinted locus residing on
                  chromosome 14 in human, 12 in mouse and 6 in
                  rat. Our computational tool can be accessed on the
                  world-wide-web.CONCLUSION:Our results show that the
                  assumption that many miRNAs occur in clusters is
                  fruitful for the discovery of novel
                  miRNAs. Additionally we show that although the
                  overall miRNA content in the observed clusters is
                  very similar across the three considered species,
                  the internal organization of the clusters changes in
                  evolution.}

  abstract =	 {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a novel,
                  phylogenetically extensive family of small RNAs (22
                  nucleotides) with potential roles in gene
                  regulation. Apart from the finding that miRNAs are
                  produced by Dicer from the precursors of 70
                  nucleotides (pre-miRNAs), little is known about
                  miRNA biogenesis. Some miRNA genes have been found
                  in close conjunction, suggesting that they are
                  expressed as single transcriptional units. Here, we
                  present in vivo and in vitro evidence that these
                  clustered miRNAs are expressed polycistronically and
                  are processed through at least two sequential steps:
                  (i) generation of the 70 nucleotide pre-miRNAs from
                  the longer transcripts (termed pri-miRNAs); and (ii)
                  processing of pre-miRNAs into mature
                  miRNAs. Subcellular localization studies showed that
                  the first and second steps are compartmentalized
                  into the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, and
                  that the pre-miRNA serves as the substrate for
                  nuclear export. Our study suggests that the
                  regulation of miRNA expression may occur at multiple
                  levels, including the two processing steps and the
                  nuclear export step. These data will provide a
                  framework for further studies on miRNA biogenesis.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (simply miRNAs) are derived
                  from larger hairpin RNA precursors and play
                  essential regular roles in both animals and
                  plants. A number of computational methods for miRNA
                  genes finding have been proposed in the past decade,
                  yet the problem is far from being tackled,
                  especially when considering the imbalance issue of
                  known miRNAs and unidentified miRNAs, and the
                  pre-miRNAs with multi-loops or higher minimum free
                  energy (MFE). This paper presents a new
                  computational approach, miRenSVM, for finding miRNA
                  genes. Aiming at better prediction performance, an
                  ensemble support vector machine (SVM) classifier is
                  established to deal with the imbalance issue, and
                  multi-loop features are included for identifying
                  those pre-miRNAs with multi-loops.RESULTS:We
                  collected a representative dataset, which contains
                  697 real miRNA precursors identified by experimental
                  procedure and other computational methods, and 5428
                  pseudo ones from several datasets. Experiments
                  showed that our miRenSVM achieved a 96.5\%
                  specificity and a 93.05\% sensitivity on the
                  dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art
                  approaches, miRenSVM obtained better prediction
                  results. We also applied our method to predict 14
                  Homo sapiens pre-miRNAs and 13 Anopheles gambiae
                  pre-miRNAs that first appeared in miRBase13.0,
                  MiRenSVM got a 100\% prediction rate. Furthermore,
                  performance evaluation was conducted over 27
                  additional species in miRBase13.0, and 92.84\%
                  (4863/5238) animal pre-miRNAs were correctly
                  identified by miRenSVM.CONCLUSION:MiRenSVM is an
                  ensemble support vector machine (SVM) classification
                  system for better detecting miRNA genes, especially
                  those with multi-loop secondary structure.},

                  post-transcriptional gene regulation in animals and
                  plants. Several existing computational approaches
                  have been developed to complement experimental
                  methods in discovery of miRNAs that express
                  restrictively in specific environmental conditions
                  or cell types. These computational methods require a
                  sufficient number of characterized miRNAs as
                  training samples, and rely on genome annotation to
                  reduce the number of predicted putative
                  miRNAs. However, most sequenced genomes have not
                  been well annotated and many of them have a very few
                  experimentally characterized miRNAs. As a result,
                  the existing methods are not effective or even
                  feasible for identifying miRNAs in these
                  genomes.Aiming at identifying miRNAs from genomes
                  with a few known miRNA and/or little annotation, we
                  propose and develop a novel miRNA prediction method,
                  miRank, based on our new random walks- based ranking
                  algorithm. We first tested our method on Homo
                  sapiens genome; using a very few known human miRNAs
                  as samples, our method achieved a prediction
                  accuracy greater than 95\%. We then applied our
                  method to predict 200 miRNAs in Anopheles gambiae,
                  which is the most important vector of malaria in
                  Africa. Our further study showed that 78 out of the
                  200 putative miRNA precursors encode mature miRNAs
                  that are conserved in at least one other animal
                  species. These conserved putative miRNAs are good
                  candidates for further experimental study to
                  understand malaria infection.Availability: MiRank is

                  are endogenous small noncoding RNA gene products, on
                  average 22 nt long, found in a wide variety of
                  organisms. They play important regulatory roles by
                  targeting mRNAs for degradation or translational
                  repression. There are 377 known mouse miRNAs and 475
                  known human miRNAs in the May 2007 release of the
                  miRBase database, the majority of which are
                  conserved between the two species. A number of
                  recent reports imply that it is likely that many
                  mammalian miRNAs remain to be discovered. The
                  possibility that there are more of them expressed at
                  lower levels or in more specialized expression
                  contexts calls for the exploitation of genome

                  vector machine models sequentially to discover new
                  miRNA candidates in mammalian genomes based on
                  sequence, secondary structure, and
                  conservation. mirCoS can efficiently detect the
                  majority of known miRNAs and predicts an extensive
                  set of hairpin structures based on human-mouse
                  comparisons. In total, 3476 mouse candidates and
                  3441 human candidates were found. These hairpins are
                  more similar to known miRNAs than to negative
                  controls in several aspects not considered by the

                  classification of human precursor microRNA
                  (pre-miRNAs) hairpins from both genome pseudo
                  hairpins and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is a
                  common and essential requirement for both
                  comparative and non-comparative computational
                  recognition of human miRNA genes. However, the
                  existing computational methods do not address this
                  issue completely or successfully. Here we present
                  the development of an effective classifier system
                  (named as microPred) for this classification problem
                  by using appropriate machine learning
                  techniques. Our approach includes the introduction
                  of more representative datasets, extraction of new
                  biologically relevant features, feature selection,
                  handling of class imbalance problem in the datasets

                  systematic cross-validation methods.Results: Our
                  microPred classifier yielded higher and, especially,
                  much more reliable classification results in terms
                  of both sensitivity (90.02\%) and specificity
                  (97.28\%) than the exiting pre-miRNA classification
                  methods. When validated with 6095 non-human animal
                  pre-miRNAs and 139 virus pre-miRNAs from miRBase,
                  microPred resulted in 92.71\% (5651/6095) and

                  participating in diverse cellular and physiological
                  processes through the post-transcriptional gene
                  regulatory pathway. Critically associated with the
                  miRNAs biogenesis, the hairpin structure is a
                  necessary feature for the computational
                  classification of novel precursor miRNAs
                  (pre-miRs). Though many of the abundant genomic
                  inverted repeats (pseudo hairpins) can be filtered
                  computationally, novel species-specific pre-miRs are
                  likely to remain elusive.Results: miPred is a de
                  novo Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for
                  identifying pre-miRs without relying on phylogenetic
                  conservation. To achieve significantly higher
                  sensitivity and specificity than existing (quasi) de
                  novo predictors, it employs a Gaussian Radial Basis
                  Function kernel (RBF) as a similarity measure for 29
                  global and intrinsic hairpin folding
                  attributes. They characterize a pre-miR at the

                  statistical thermodynamics and topological
                  levels. Trained on 200 human pre-miRs and 400 pseudo
                  hairpins, miPred achieves 93.50\% (5-fold
                  cross-validation accuracy) and 0.9833 (ROC
                  score). Tested on the remaining 123 human pre-miRs
                  and 246 pseudo hairpins, it reports 84.55\%
                  (sensitivity), 97.97\% (specificity) and 93.50\%
                  (accuracy). Validated onto 1918 pre-miRs across 40
                  non-human species and 3836 pseudo hairpins, it
                  yields 87.65\% (92.08\%), 97.75\% (97.42\%) and

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:Secondary structure forms an important
                  intermediate level of description of nucleic acids
                  that encapsulates the dominating part of the folding
                  energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is
                  routinely used as a basis to explain experimental
                  findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic
                  parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can
                  be used to compute ground states, base pairing
                  probabilities, as well as thermodynamic
                  properties.RESULTS:The ViennaRNA Package has been a
                  widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure
                  related computer programs for nearly two
                  decades. Major changes in the structure of the
                  standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters,
                  the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an
                  increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a
                  major technical overhaul of both the underlying
                  RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New
                  features include an expanded repertoire of tools to
                  assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles
                  of structures, additional output information such as
                  centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy
                  structures derived from base pairing probabilities,
                  or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures,
                  and support for input in fasta format. Updates were
                  implemented without compromising the computational
                  efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring
                  compatibility with earlier versions.CONCLUSIONS:The

  ABSTRACT =	 {BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of short
                  (~22 nt) non-coding RNAs that play important
                  regulatory roles. MiRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are
                  characterized by their hairpin structures. However,
                  a large amount of similar hairpins can be folded in
                  many genomes. Almost all current methods for
                  computational prediction of miRNAs use comparative
                  genomic approaches to identify putative pre-miRNAs
                  from candidate hairpins. Ab initio method for
                  distinguishing pre-miRNAs from sequence segments
                  with pre-miRNA-like hairpin structures is
                  lacking. Being able to classify real vs. pseudo
                  pre-miRNAs is important both for understanding of
                  the nature of miRNAs and for developing ab initio
                  prediction methods that can discovery new miRNAs
                  without known homology.RESULTS:A set of novel
                  features of local contiguous structure-sequence
                  information is proposed for distinguishing the
                  hairpins of real pre-miRNAs and pseudo

                  on these features to classify real vs. pseudo
                  pre-miRNAs, achieving about 90\% accuracy on human
                  data. Remarkably, the SVM classifier built on human
                  data can correctly identify up to 90\% of the
                  pre-miRNAs from other species, including plants and
                  virus, without utilizing any comparative genomics
                  information.CONCLUSION:The local structure-sequence
                  features reflect discriminative and conserved
                  characteristics of miRNAs, and the successful ab
                  initio classification of real and pseudo pre-miRNAs
                  opens a new approach for discovering new miRNAs.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Since microRNAs (miRNAs) were discovered, their
                  impact on regulating various biological activities
                  has been a surprising and exciting field. Knowing
                  the entire repertoire of these small molecules is
                  the first step to gain a better understanding of
                  their function. High throughput discovery tools such
                  as next-generation sequencing significantly
                  increased the number of miRNAs in different
                  organisms in recent years. However, the process of
                  being able to accurately identify miRNA is still a
                  complex and difficult task, requiring the
                  integration of experimental approaches with
                  computational methods. A number of prediction
                  algorisms based on characteristics of miRNA
                  molecules have been developed to identify new miRNA
                  species. Different approaches have certain strengths
                  and weaknesses and, in this review, we aim to
                  summarize several commonly used tools in miRNA
                  discovery and provide some prospects on future
                  developments.}

                  curve (AUC) as a performance measure for machine
                  learning algorithms. As a case study we evaluate six
                  machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale

                  compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity

                  task of data mining, where the goal is to discover
                  rules predicting the class of examples (records of a
                  given dataset). In the context of data mining, small
                  disjuncts are rules covering a small number of
                  examples. Hence, these rules are usually
                  error-prone, which contributes to a decrease in
                  predictive accuracy. At first glance, this is not a
                  serious problem, since the impact on predictive
                  accuracy should be small. However, although each
                  small-disjunct covers few examples, the set of all
                  small disjuncts can cover a large number of
                  examples. This paper presents evidence that this is
                  the case in several datasets. This paper also
                  addresses the problem of small disjuncts by using a
                  hybrid decision-tree/genetic-algorithm approach. In
                  essence, examples belonging to large disjuncts are
                  classified by rules produced by a decision-tree
                  algorithm (C4.5), while examples belonging to small
                  disjuncts are classified by a genetic-algorithm
                  specifically designed for discovering small-disjunct
                  rules. We present results comparing the predictive
                  accuracy of this hybrid system with the prediction
                  accuracy of three versions of C4.5 alone in eight
                  public domain datasets. Overall, the results show
                  that our hybrid system achieves better predictive
                  accuracy than all three versions of C4.5 alone. "

                  reduced drastically. The proposed methodology
                  suggests the use of a new model selection criterion
                  based on the estimation of the probability of error
                  of the \{SVM\} classifier. For comparison, we
                  considered two more model selection criteria:
                  \{GACV\} (‘Generalized Approximate
                  Cross-Validation’) and \{VC\}
                  (‘Vapnik-Chernovenkis’) dimension. These criteria
                  are algebraic estimates of upper bounds of the
                  expected error. For the former, we also propose a
                  new minimization scheme. The experiments conducted
                  on a bi-class problem show that we can adequately
                  choose the \{SVM\} hyper-parameters using the
                  empirical error criterion. Moreover, it turns out
                  that the criterion produces a less complex model
                  with fewer support vectors. For multi-class data,
                  the optimization strategy is adapted to the
                  one-against-one data partitioning. The approach is
                  then evaluated on images of handwritten digits from
                  the \{USPS\} database. "

                  estimate of generalization error or some other

                  (in the sense that they do not require expensive

                  results point out which of these measures are
                  adequate functionals for tuning \{SVM\}
                  hyperparameters. For \{SVMs\} with \{L1\}
                  soft-margin formulation, none of the simple measures
                  yields a performance uniformly as good as k-fold

                  \{GACV\} of Wahba et al. come next and perform
                  reasonably well. For \{SVMs\} with \{L2\}
                  soft-margin formulation, the radius margin bound
