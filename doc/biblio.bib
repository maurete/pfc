abstract ={In eukaryotes, 21- to 24-nucleotide-long RNAs engage in sequence-specific interactions that inhibit gene expression by RNA silencing. This process has regulatory roles involving microRNAs and, in plants and insects, it also forms the basis of a defense mechanism directed by small interfering RNAs that derive from replicative or integrated viral genomes. We show that a cellular microRNA effectively restricts the accumulation of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) in human cells. PFV-1 also encodes a protein, Tas, that suppresses microRNA-directed functions in mammalian cells and displays cross-kingdom antisilencing activities. Therefore, through fortuitous recognition of foreign nucleic acids, cellular microRNAs have direct antiviral effects in addition to their regulatory functions.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 21 to 23-nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate protein-coding gene expression in plants and animals via the RNA interference pathway. Hundreds of them have been identified in the last five years and very recent works indicate that their total number is still larger. Therefore miRNAs gene discovery remains an important aspect of understanding this new and still widely unknown regulation mechanism. Bioinformatics approaches have proved to be very useful toward this goal by guiding the experimental investigations.RESULTS:In this work we describe our computational method for miRNA prediction and the results of its application to the discovery of novel mammalian miRNAs. We focus on genomic regions around already known miRNAs, in order to exploit the property that miRNAs are occasionally found in clusters. Starting with the known human, mouse and rat miRNAs we analyze 20 kb of flanking genomic regions for the presence of putative precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Each genome is analyzed separately, allowing us to study the species-specific identity and genome organization of miRNA loci. We only use cross-species comparisons to make conservative estimates of the number of novel miRNAs. Our ab initio method predicts between fifty and hundred novel pre-miRNAs for each of the considered species. Around 30\% of these already have experimental support in a large set of cloned mammalian small RNAs. The validation rate among predicted cases that are conserved in at least one other species is higher, about 60\%, and many of them have not been detected by prediction methods that used cross-species comparisons. A large fraction of the experimentally confirmed predictions correspond to an imprinted locus residing on chromosome 14 in human, 12 in mouse and 6 in rat. Our computational tool can be accessed on the world-wide-web.CONCLUSION:Our results show that the assumption that many miRNAs occur in clusters is fruitful for the discovery of novel miRNAs. Additionally we show that although the overall miRNA content in the observed clusters is very similar across the three considered species, the internal organization of the clusters changes in evolution.}

  abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a novel, phylogenetically extensive family of small RNAs (22 nucleotides) with potential roles in gene regulation. Apart from the finding that miRNAs are produced by Dicer from the precursors of 70 nucleotides (pre-miRNAs), little is known about miRNA biogenesis. Some miRNA genes have been found in close conjunction, suggesting that they are expressed as single transcriptional units. Here, we present in vivo and in vitro evidence that these clustered miRNAs are expressed polycistronically and are processed through at least two sequential steps: (i) generation of the 70 nucleotide pre-miRNAs from the longer transcripts (termed pri-miRNAs); and (ii) processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs. Subcellular localization studies showed that the first and second steps are compartmentalized into the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, and that the pre-miRNA serves as the substrate for nuclear export. Our study suggests that the regulation of miRNA expression may occur at multiple levels, including the two processing steps and the nuclear export step. These data will provide a framework for further studies on miRNA biogenesis.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (simply miRNAs) are derived from larger hairpin RNA precursors and play essential regular roles in both animals and plants. A number of computational methods for miRNA genes finding have been proposed in the past decade, yet the problem is far from being tackled, especially when considering the imbalance issue of known miRNAs and unidentified miRNAs, and the pre-miRNAs with multi-loops or higher minimum free energy (MFE). This paper presents a new computational approach, miRenSVM, for finding miRNA genes. Aiming at better prediction performance, an ensemble support vector machine (SVM) classifier is established to deal with the imbalance issue, and multi-loop features are included for identifying those pre-miRNAs with multi-loops.RESULTS:We collected a representative dataset, which contains 697 real miRNA precursors identified by experimental procedure and other computational methods, and 5428 pseudo ones from several datasets. Experiments showed that our miRenSVM achieved a 96.5\% specificity and a 93.05\% sensitivity on the dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, miRenSVM obtained better prediction results. We also applied our method to predict 14 Homo sapiens pre-miRNAs and 13 Anopheles gambiae pre-miRNAs that first appeared in miRBase13.0, MiRenSVM got a 100\% prediction rate. Furthermore, performance evaluation was conducted over 27 additional species in miRBase13.0, and 92.84\% (4863/5238) animal pre-miRNAs were correctly identified by miRenSVM.CONCLUSION:MiRenSVM is an ensemble support vector machine (SVM) classification system for better detecting miRNA genes, especially those with multi-loop secondary structure.},

abstract ={MicroRNA (miRNAs) play essential roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation in animals and plants. Several existing computational approaches have been developed to complement experimental methods in discovery of miRNAs that express restrictively in specific environmental conditions or cell types. These computational methods require a sufficient number of characterized miRNAs as training samples, and rely on genome annotation to reduce the number of predicted putative miRNAs. However, most sequenced genomes have not been well annotated and many of them have a very few experimentally characterized miRNAs. As a result, the existing methods are not effective or even feasible for identifying miRNAs in these genomes.Aiming at identifying miRNAs from genomes with a few known miRNA and/or little annotation, we propose and develop a novel miRNA prediction method, miRank, based on our new random walks- based ranking algorithm. We first tested our method on Homo sapiens genome; using a very few known human miRNAs as samples, our method achieved a prediction accuracy greater than 95\%. We then applied our method to predict 200 miRNAs in Anopheles gambiae, which is the most important vector of malaria in Africa. Our further study showed that 78 out of the 200 putative miRNA precursors encode mature miRNAs that are conserved in at least one other animal species. These conserved putative miRNAs are good candidates for further experimental study to understand malaria infection.Availability: MiRank is programmed in Matlab on Windows platform.

abstract ={Motivation: In this article, we show that the classification of human precursor microRNA (pre-miRNAs) hairpins from both genome pseudo hairpins and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is a common and essential requirement for both comparative and non-comparative computational recognition of human miRNA genes. However, the existing computational methods do not address this issue completely or successfully. Here we present the development of an effective classifier system (named as microPred) for this classification problem by using appropriate machine learning techniques. Our approach includes the introduction of more representative datasets, extraction of new biologically relevant features, feature selection, handling of class imbalance problem in the datasets and extensive classifier performance evaluation via systematic cross-validation methods.Results: Our microPred classifier yielded higher and, especially, much more reliable classification results in terms of both sensitivity (90.02\%) and specificity (97.28\%) than the exiting pre-miRNA classification methods. When validated with 6095 non-human animal pre-miRNAs and 139 virus pre-miRNAs from miRBase, microPred resulted in 92.71\% (5651/6095) and 94.24\% (131/139) recognition rates, respectively.Availability: The microPred classifier, the datasets used, and the features extracted are freely available at http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/ManoharaRukshan.Batuwita/microPred.htm.Contact: manb@comlab.ox.ac.uk; vasile.palade@comlab.ox.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs participating in diverse cellular and physiological processes through the post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathway. Critically associated with the miRNAs biogenesis, the hairpin structure is a necessary feature for the computational classification of novel precursor miRNAs (pre-miRs). Though many of the abundant genomic inverted repeats (pseudo hairpins) can be filtered computationally, novel species-specific pre-miRs are likely to remain elusive.Results: miPred is a de novo Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for identifying pre-miRs without relying on phylogenetic conservation. To achieve significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than existing (quasi) de novo predictors, it employs a Gaussian Radial Basis Function kernel (RBF) as a similarity measure for 29 global and intrinsic hairpin folding attributes. They characterize a pre-miR at the dinucleotide sequence, hairpin folding, non-linear statistical thermodynamics and topological levels. Trained on 200 human pre-miRs and 400 pseudo hairpins, miPred achieves 93.50\% (5-fold cross-validation accuracy) and 0.9833 (ROC score). Tested on the remaining 123 human pre-miRs and 246 pseudo hairpins, it reports 84.55\% (sensitivity), 97.97\% (specificity) and 93.50\% (accuracy). Validated onto 1918 pre-miRs across 40 non-human species and 3836 pseudo hairpins, it yields 87.65\% (92.08\%), 97.75\% (97.42\%) and 94.38\% (95.64\%) for the mean (overall) sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.RESULTS:The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.CONCLUSIONS:The ViennaRNA Package 2.0, supporting concurrent computations via OpenMP, can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA webcite.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of short (~22 nt) non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles. MiRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) are characterized by their hairpin structures. However, a large amount of similar hairpins can be folded in many genomes. Almost all current methods for computational prediction of miRNAs use comparative genomic approaches to identify putative pre-miRNAs from candidate hairpins. Ab initio method for distinguishing pre-miRNAs from sequence segments with pre-miRNA-like hairpin structures is lacking. Being able to classify real vs. pseudo pre-miRNAs is important both for understanding of the nature of miRNAs and for developing ab initio prediction methods that can discovery new miRNAs without known homology.RESULTS:A set of novel features of local contiguous structure-sequence information is proposed for distinguishing the hairpins of real pre-miRNAs and pseudo pre-miRNAs. Support vector machine (SVM) is applied on these features to classify real vs. pseudo pre-miRNAs, achieving about 90\% accuracy on human data. Remarkably, the SVM classifier built on human data can correctly identify up to 90\% of the pre-miRNAs from other species, including plants and virus, without utilizing any comparative genomics information.CONCLUSION:The local structure-sequence features reflect discriminative and conserved characteristics of miRNAs, and the successful ab initio classification of real and pseudo pre-miRNAs opens a new approach for discovering new miRNAs.},
